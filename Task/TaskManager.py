# Task #1
# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

# Difference between = and == Operators in Python
# = Operator: This is the assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
# == Operator: This is the equality operator. It is used to compare two values to see if they are equal. For example, x == 5 checks if the value of x is equal to 5.

# The ** Operator in Python
# The ** operator is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise a number to the power of another number. For example, 2 ** 3 calculates (2) raised to the power of (3), which equals (8).

# The ^ Operator in Python
# The ^ operator is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It is used to compare each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 where the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1. For example, 5 ^ 3 results in 6 because the binary representation of 5 is 101 and 3 is 011, and the XOR operation results in 110 which is 6 in decimal.

# Task #2
# Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8
# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.#
# Push the code to Github.com
